# general purpose images and folders

A new sheet "img" was added to the Excel file.
The sheet contains the columns 
imgfolder
filename

Aditionally to the current image folders containing images of collection, the folders and images mentioned in the sheet img must also be included in the pipeline to be copied and included as images for general purposes in the site.



# Hero slider , Index

We are making some changes to the index hero section logic.
Columns added to the Excel , sheet IndexheroSlides:

slidertype
Imagefolder
collection


There Will be two types of slides:
* type "collection"
* type "url"


# Slide type "collection"

A slide type collection keep a similar behavior to the current. 

* if the slidertype = "collection" then the CTA is linked to the page "catalogo" with collection as parameter (value found at the column collection) 


# Slide type URL

* if the slidertype = "url" then the CTA is linked to the URL declared at the column "link"


notes: 

* title is never asummed as a parameter containing the collection, only the column collection must be assumed as collection for any purpose. Audit the script so we accomplish this condition. the only use of title is to define the h1 title for the slider.

* both images sampleImage and ambientImage Will be found at the folder declared in the column Imagefolder
